TEST RESULTS - SDLC Project Validation
========================================
Date: 2025-12-12
Project: /tmp/test-sdlc-project14

PROJECT ANALYSIS
-----------------
Status: NO SOURCE CODE FOUND
Result: CANNOT RUN TESTS

FINDINGS:
---------
1. Project Structure Analysis:
   - No source code files found (no .py, .js, .ts, .rs, .go, .java files)
   - No package.json, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, or other dependency files
   - No src/, lib/, app/, or similar source directories
   - No test/ or tests/ directories with actual test files

2. Directory Contents:
   - .claude/ - Claude Code configuration and hooks
   - artifacts/ - Documentation artifacts from previous workflow runs
   - logs/ - Log files from previous sessions
   - agents/ - Agent state files

3. Artifacts Found:
   - feature-spec.md (content: "Agent completed")
   - implementation-summary.md (content: "Agent completed")
   - code-review.md
   - Previous test-results.txt (content: "Agent completed")

CONCLUSION:
-----------
This appears to be a test/development directory for an SDLC workflow system
rather than an actual software project with source code. There are no tests
to run because there is no implementation code present.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
To run tests, this project needs:
1. Source code files in a standard project structure
2. A test framework configuration (pytest, jest, cargo test, etc.)
3. Test files with actual test cases
4. Dependencies defined in a package/project file

VALIDATION STATUS: N/A - No code to validate
TEST EXECUTION: SKIPPED - No tests available
PASS/FAIL: N/A
